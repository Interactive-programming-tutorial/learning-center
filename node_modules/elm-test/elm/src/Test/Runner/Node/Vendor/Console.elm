-- NOTE: This is copy/pasted from https://github.com/rtfeldman/console-print
-- It's inlined to avoid having to call elm-package install on the end user's
-- system - the approach this library took prior to
-- commit 19047f01d460739bfe7f16466bc60b41430a8f09 - because it assumes
-- the end user has the correct elm-package on their PATH, which is not a
-- safe assumption.
